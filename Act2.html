<h1 id="ea">Algebraic Equation</h1>
<p><b>Algebraic equation,</b> statment ot the equality of the two expressions formulated by applying to a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Example are <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + 1 and (<i>y</i><sup>4</sup> + 2<i>xy</i> - <i>y</i>) / (<i>x</i>-1) = 12. An important special casee of such equations is that of polynomial equaitions, expressions of the form <i>axn</i> + <i>bxn</i><sup>-1</sup> + ... + <i>gx</i> +<i>h = k.</i> They have as many solutions as their degree (<i>n</i>), and the search for their solutions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra. Equations like <i>(x) = c</i> that involve nonagebraic operations, such as logarithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcedental.</p><br>

<h2 id="cc"> Chemical compound</h2>
<pre>
</pre>
A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determining the compositon.
<pre>
</pre>
The ratio of each element is usally expressed by chemical fomula.
<pre>
</pre>
<p>For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p>The atoms within a compund can be held together by a variety if interactions, ranging from covalent bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.</p>
<p>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p>For example H<sub>2</sub>O is held together by polar covalaent bonds.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p>Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.</p><br>
